## How to run:
- Clone the repository
- Navigate inside EDMToolkit
- **Before every execution, please run `sh clean_pycs.sh` on the root folder to clean all binaries**
- run the `sh trigger_script.sh <name_of_python_file_to_run>`. For example I run `sh trigger_script.sh Backend/tester.py` to run some tests on the backend code.
- Make sure that all the code in the Backend has a `__init.py__` file associated to make it a importable library.
- The `FirstPage.py` file represents the entrypoint of the application. Run this file as `python FirstPage.py`
